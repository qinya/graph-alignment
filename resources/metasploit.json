The vulnerability is within the \"sreplace\" function within the \"src/support.c\" file.  The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug since then.  Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'.  We were unable to reach the \"sreplace\" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them:  1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace! 2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via the \"pr_display_file\" function! 3. stupid '.message' file display bug  So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit. To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a writeable directory, then do \"CWD <writeable directory>\" to trigger the invocation of sreplace function.  Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message' file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug.  The exploit is a part of VulnDisco Pack since Dec 2005."

By sending data containing a large number of Telnet IAC commands, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code.  The Debian Squeeze version of the exploit uses a little ROP stub to indirectly transfer the flow of execution to a pool buffer (the cmd_rec \"res\" in \"pr_cmd_read\").  The Ubuntu version uses a ROP stager to mmap RWX memory, copy a small stub to it, and execute the stub. The stub then copies the remainder of the payload in and executes it.  NOTE: Most Linux distributions either do not ship a vulnerable version of ProFTPD, or they ship a version compiled with stack smashing protection.  Although SSP significantly reduces the probability of a single attempt succeeding, it will not prevent exploitation. Since the daemon forks in a default configuration, the cookie value will remain the same despite some attemtps failing. By making repeated requests, an attacker can eventually guess the cookie value and exploit the vulnerability.  The cookie in Ubuntu has 24-bits of entropy. This reduces the effectiveness and could allow exploitation in semi-reasonable amount of time."

This module abuses the known default encryption keys to inject a message into the communication bus.

This service exposes a function named 'insert_plugin_meta_info' which is vulnerable to an input validation flaw in a call to system().

By setting this value to a number larger than the destination buffer size, an attacker can corrupt memory. Additionally, setting this value to a value smaller than 'smb_wct' (0x24) will cause the header of the input buffer chunk to be corrupted.  After close inspection, it appears that 3.0.x versions of Samba are not exploitable. Since they use an \"InputBuffer\" size of 0x20441, an attacker cannot cause memory to be corrupted in an exploitable way. It is possible to corrupt the heap header of the \"InputBuffer\", but it didn't seem possible to get the chunk to be processed again prior to process exit.  In order to gain code execution, this exploit attempts to overwrite a \"talloc chunk\" destructor function pointer.  This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the nx memory protection.

The SigningCert option allows you to provide a trusted code signing cert, the values in which will override CERTCN. If SigningCert is not given, a randomly generated self-signed cert will be used.  Either way, once the user clicks \"run\", the applet executes with full user permissions."

This particular module targets numerous web applications and is based on the proof of concept provided by Stefan Esser. This vulnerability requires approximately 900k of data to trigger due the multiple Cookie headers requirement. Since we are already assuming a fast network connection, we use a 2Mb block of shellcode for the brute force, allowing quick exploitation for those with fast networks.  One of the neat things about this vulnerability is that on x86 systems, the EDI register points into the beginning of the hashtable string. This can be used with an egghunter to quickly exploit systems where the location of a valid \"jmp EDI\" or \"call EDI\" instruction is known. The EDI method is faster, but the bandwidth-intensive brute force used by this module is more reliable across a wider range of systems."

      "fullDescription": "This module exploits a heap buffer overflow within versions of Exim prior to version 4.69. By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can corrupt the heap and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon.  The root cause is that no check is made to ensure that the buffer is not full prior to handling '%s' format specifiers within the 'string_vformat' function. In order to trigger this issue, we get our message rejected by sending a message that is too large. This will call into log_write to log rejection headers (which is a default configuration setting). After filling the buffer, a long header string is sent. In a successful attempt, it overwrites the ACL for the 'MAIL FROM' command. By sending a second message, the string we sent will be evaluated with 'expand_string' and arbitrary shell commands can be executed.  It is likely that this issue could also be exploited using other techniques such as targeting in-band heap management structures, or perhaps even function pointers stored in the heap. However, these techniques would likely be far more platform specific, more complicated, and less reliable.  This bug was original found and reported in December 2008, but was not properly handled as a security issue. Therefore, there was a 2 year lag time between when the issue was fixed and when it was discovered being exploited in the wild. At that point, the issue was assigned a CVE and began being addressed by downstream vendors.  An additional vulnerability, CVE-2010-4345, was also used in the attack that led to the discovery of danger of this bug. This bug allows a local user to gain root privileges from the Exim user account. If the Perl interpreter is found on the remote system, this module will automatically exploit the secondary bug as well to get root."

Numerous reports also indicate that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild."

      "fullDescription": "This module exploits a format string vulnerability within version 10.0.4.x and 10.5.1 of the SonicWALL Aventail SSL-VPN Endpoint Interrogator/Installer ActiveX control (epi.dll). By calling the 'AuthCredential' method with a specially crafted Unicode format string, an attacker can cause memory corruption and execute arbitrary code.  Unfortunately, it does not appear to be possible to indirectly re-use existing stack data for more reliable exploitation. This is due to several particulars about this vulnerability. First, the format string must be a Unicode string, which uses two bytes per character. Second, the buffer is allocated on the stack using the 'alloca' function. As such, each additional format specifier (%x) will add four more bytes to the size allocated. This results in the inability to move the read pointer outside of the buffer.  Further testing showed that using specifiers that pop more than four bytes does not help. Any number of format specifiers will result in accessing the same value within the buffer.  NOTE: It may be possible to leverage the vulnerability to leak memory contents. However, that has not been fully investigated at this time."

This security flaw is not uncommon  in corporate environments for the 'Intranet' or 'Trusted Site' zones. In order to  save binary data to the file system, ADODB.Stream access is required, which in IE7  will trigger a cross domain access violation. As such, we write the code to a .vbs  file and execute it from there, where no such restrictions exist.  When set via domain policy, the most common registry entry to modify is HKLM\\  Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Zones\\1\\1201,  which if set to '0' forces ActiveX controls not marked safe for scripting to be  enabled for the Intranet zone.

By specifying specific parameters to the new plugin, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code.  When the new plugin is invoked with a \"launchjnlp\" parameter, it will copy the contents of the \"docbase\" parameter to a stack-buffer using the \"sprintf\" function. A string of 396 bytes is enough to overflow the 256 byte stack buffer and overwrite some local variables as well as the saved return address.  NOTE: The string being copied is first passed through the \"WideCharToMultiByte\". Due to this, only characters which have a valid localized multibyte representation are allowed. Invalid characters will be replaced with question marks ('?').  This vulnerability was originally discovered independently by both Stephen Fewer and Berend Jan Wever (SkyLined). Although exhaustive testing hasn't been done, all versions since version 6 Update 10 are believed to be affected by this vulnerability.  This vulnerability was patched as part of the October 2010 Oracle Patch release."

This exploit results in a call to an address lower than the heap. The javascript prompt() places our shellcode near where the call operand points to. We call prompt() multiple times in separate iframes to place our return address. We hide the prompts in a popup window behind the main window. We spray the heap a second time with our shellcode and point the return address to the heap. I use a fairly high address to make this exploit more reliable. IE will crash when the exploit completes. Also, please note that Internet Explorer must allow popups in order to continue exploitation."

      "fullDescription": "Thie module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability within Microsoft's HTML engine (mshtml). When parsing an HTML page containing a specially crafted CSS tag, memory corruption occurs that can lead arbitrary code execution.  It seems like Microsoft code inadvertantly increments a vtable pointer to point to an unaligned address within the vtable's function pointers. This leads to the program counter being set to the address determined by the address \"[vtable+0x30+1]\". The particular address depends on the exact version of the mshtml library in use.  Since the address depends on the version of mshtml, some versions may not be exploitable. Specifically, those ending up with a program counter value within another module, in kernel space, or just not able to be reached with various memory spraying techniques.  Also, since the address is not controllable, it is unlikely to be possible to use ROP to bypass non-executable memory protections."

Exploitation is done by supplying a specially crafted MIDI file with specific events, causing the offset calculation being higher than what is available on the heap (0x400 allocated by WINMM!winmmAlloc), and then allowing us to either \"inc al\" or \"dec al\" a byte. This can be used to corrupt an array (CImplAry) we setup, and force the browser to confuse types from tagVARIANT objects, which leverages remote code execution under the context of the user.  Note: At this time, for IE 8 target, msvcrt ROP is used by default. However, if you know your target's patch level, you may also try the 'MSHTML' advanced option for an info leak based attack. Currently, this module only supports two MSHTML builds: 8.0.6001.18702, which is often seen in a newly installed XP SP3. Or 8.0.6001.19120, which is patch level before the MS12-004 fix.

This stack buffer overflow allows remote code execution in kernel mode. The stack buffer overflow is triggered when a 802.11 Beacon frame is received that contains a long Rates information element. This exploit was tested with version 1.0.1.41 of the A5AGU.SYS driver and a D-Link DWL-G132 USB adapter (HW: A2, FW: 1.02). Newer versions of the A5AGU.SYS driver are provided with the D-Link WUA-2340 adapter and appear to resolve this flaw, but D-Link does not offer an updated driver for the DWL-G132. Since this vulnerability is exploited via beacon frames, all cards within range of the attack will be affected. The tested adapter used a MAC address in the range of 00:11:95:f2:XX:XX.  Vulnerable clients will need to have their card in a non-associated state for this exploit to work. The easiest way to reproduce this bug is by starting the exploit and then accessing the Windows wireless network browser and forcing it to refresh.  D-Link was NOT contacted about this flaw. A search of the SecurityFocus database indicates that D-Link has not provided an official patch or solution for any of the seven flaws listed at the time of writing: (BIDs 13679, 16621, 16690, 18168, 18299, 19006, and 20689).

      "fullDescription": "The IBM Personal Communications I-Series application WorkStation is susceptible to a  stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability within file parsing in which data copied to a  location in memory exceeds the size of the reserved destination area. The buffer is located  on the runtime program stack.   When the WorkStation file is opened it will reach the code path at 0x67575180 located in  pcspref.dll which conducts string manipulation and validation on the data supplied in the  WorkStation file. The application will first check if 'Profile' header exists and appends  a dot with the next parameter within the file. It will then measure the character length  of the header by calling strcspn with a dot as its null-terminated character.   It will then write the header into memory and ensure the header ends with a NUL character.  The parameter character array is passed to the strcpy() function. The application has  declared a 52-element character array for the destination for strcpy function. The  function does not perform bounds checking therefore, data can be written paste the end of  the buffer variable resulting in corruption of adjacent variables including other local  variables, program state information and function arguments. You will notice that the  saved RETURN address at offset 0x6c is overwritten by the data written past the buffer.   To ensure we can perform arbitrary code execution we must we provide a valid pointer at  0x74 which is used as a argument for the called function at 0x675751ED as a id file  extension parameter. Once the caller regains control we will reach our RETURN. The Ret  instruction will be used to pop the overwritten saved return address which was currupted.   This exploit has been written to bypass 2 mitigations DEP and ASLR on a Windows platform.

This allows attackers to overwrite it with any arbitrary value, and results code execution. A patch is available at visiwave.com; the fix is done by XORing the return value as null if no match is found, and then it is validated before use.  NOTE: During installation, the application will register two file handle's, VWS and VWR and allows a victim user to 'double click' the malicious VWR file and execute code.

      "fullDescription": "This module exploits an out-of-bounds array access in the Arcane Software Vermillion FTP server. By sending an specially crafted FTP PORT command, an attacker can corrupt stack memory and execute arbitrary code.  This particular issue is caused by processing data bound by attacker controlled input while writing into a 4 byte stack buffer. Unfortunately, the writing that occurs is not a simple byte copy.  Processing is done using a source ptr (p) and a destination pointer (q). The vulnerable function walks the input string and continues while the source byte is non-null. If a comma is encountered, the function increments the the destination pointer. If an ascii digit [0-9] is encountered, the following occurs:  *q = (*q * 10) + (*p - '0');  All other input characters are ignored in this loop.  As a consequence, an attacker must craft input such that modifications to the current values on the stack result in usable values. In this exploit, the low two bytes of the return address are adjusted to point at the location of a 'call edi' instruction within the binary. This was chosen since 'edi' points at the source buffer when the function returns.  NOTE: This server can be installed as a service using \"vftpd.exe install\". If so, the service does not restart automatically, giving an attacker only one attempt."

By specifying a long 'arg' parameter when executing the 'jovgraph.exe' CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerable code is within the option parsing function within \"ovwebsnmpsrv.exe\" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010.  Reaching the vulnerable code requires a 'POST' request with an 'arg' parameter that, when combined with a some static text, exceeds 10240 bytes. The parameter must begin with a dash. It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH. This is since overflowing the buffer with controllable data always triggers an access violation when attempting to write static text beyond the end of the stack.  Exploiting this issue is a bit tricky due to a restrictive character set. In order to accomplish arbitrary code execution, a double-backward jump is used in combination with the Alpha2 encoder."

When X-FromCheck is enabled (also default), the temporary form2raw.cgi data is copied by MDaemon.exe and a stack based overflow occurs when an excessively long From field is specified. The RawQueue is processed every 1 minute by default, to a maximum of 60 minutes. Keep this in mind when choosing payloads or setting WfsDelay... You'll need to wait. Furthermore, this exploit uses a direct memory jump into a nopsled (which isn't very reliable).

The address of our buffer is conveniently stored in ecx when this instruction is executed. 4. On MSSQL 2005, an additional vtable ptr is smashed, which is referenced with a displacement of 4. This pointer is not used by this exploit.  This particular exploit replaces the previous dual-method exploit. It uses a technique where the value contained in ecx becomes the stack. From there, return oriented programming is used to normalize the execution state and finally execute the payload via a \"jmp esp\".

Successful exploitation should not crash either the service or the server; however, after initial use the port cannot be reused for successive exploitation until the service has been restarted. Consider using a command execution payload following the bind shell to restart the service if you need to reuse the same port.  The overflow appears to occur in the debugging/error reporting section of the slmail.exe executable, and there are multiple offsets that will lead to successful exploitation. This exploit uses 2606, the offset that creates the smallest overall payload. The other offset is 4654.  The return address is overwritten with a \"jmp esp\" call from the application library SLMFC.DLL found in %SYSTEM%\\system32\\. This return address works against all version of Windows and service packs.  The last modification date on the library is dated 06/02/99. Assuming that the code where the overflow occurs has not changed in some time, prior version of SLMail may also be vulnerable with this exploit. The author has not been able to acquire older versions of SLMail for testing purposes. Please let us know if you were able to get this exploit working against other SLMail versions."

The attack is carried out in three stages. The first stage sends the final payload to IGSSdataServer.exe, which will remain in memory. The second stage sends the Add command so the process can find a valid ID for the Rename command. The last stage then triggers the vulnerability with the Rename command, and uses an egghunter to search for the shellcode that we sent in stage 1. The use of egghunter appears to be necessary due to the small buffer size, which cannot even contain our ROP chain and the final payload."

If the connecting user is an administrator and network logins are allowed to the target machine, this module will execute an arbitrary payload. To exploit this, the target system must try to authenticate to this module. The easiest way to force a SMB authentication attempt is by embedding a UNC path (\\\\SERVER\\SHARE) into a web page or email message. When the victim views the web page or email, their system will automatically connect to the server specified in the UNC share (the IP address of the system running this module) and attempt to authenticate. Unfortunately, this module is not able to clean up after itself. The service and payload file listed in the output will need to be manually removed after access has been gained. The service created by this tool uses a randomly chosen name and description, so the services list can become cluttered after repeated exploitation.  The SMB authentication relay attack was first reported by Sir Dystic on March 31st, 2001 at @lanta.con in Atlanta, Georgia.  On November 11th 2008 Microsoft released bulletin MS08-068. This bulletin includes a patch which prevents the relaying of challenge keys back to the host which issued them, preventing this exploit from working in the default configuration. It is still possible to set the SMBHOST parameter to a third-party host that the victim is authorized to access, but the \"reflection\" attack has been effectively broken."

By making a request that terminates abnormally (either an aborted TCP connection or an unsatisfied chunked request), mod_isapi will unload the ISAPI extension. Later, if another request comes for that ISAPI module, previously obtained pointers will be used resulting in an access violation or potentially arbitrary code execution.  Although arbitrary code execution is theoretically possible, a real-world method of invoking this consequence has not been proven. In order to do so, one would need to find a situation where a particular ISAPI module loads at an image base address that can be re-allocated by a remote attacker.  Limited success was encountered using two separate ISAPI modules. In this scenario, a second ISAPI module was loaded into the same memory area as the previously unloaded module."

By sending a specially crafted election request, an attacker can cause a pool overflow.  The vulnerability appears to be due to an error handling a length value while calculating the amount of memory to copy to a buffer. When there are zero bytes left in the buffer, the length value is improperly decremented and an integer underflow occurs. The resulting value is used in several calculations and is then passed as the length value to an inline memcpy operation.  Unfortunately, the length value appears to be fixed at -2 (0xfffffffe) and causes considerable damage to kernel heap memory. While theoretically possible, it does not appear to be trivial to turn this vulnerability into remote (or even local) code execution."
